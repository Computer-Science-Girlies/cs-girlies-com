There's no such thing as being behind in life. There's only where you are and the path that you're creating. To be behind means to be behind someone walking the same path as you. No one is walking the same path as you.

"So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” Franklin Delano Roosevelt's First Inauguration Address circa March 4, 1933. I firmly believe we are all born geniuses. Dumbing down ourselves is the price we pay for conformity. In high school, everyone was expected to be in a group aka 'a box'. The Breakfast Club exemplifies this. To  be into technology and science was to be a 'geek'. You were branded a social misfit who wore glasses with tape in the middle. The truth was 180 degrees from fiction. What we had in common was a love of technology and 60s British Invasion Rock music.

progress > perfection

you'll never be perfect at anything in life because there will always be more you feel like you need to do when you try to perfect everything, not much gets done. who cares if it isn't the best standard just yet, at least you're trying. Aim for progress...

Grit * Talent + Grit * Skill

Talent is innate, but it means nothing without perseverance. Skill is like talent, but earned through years of experience—and it's entirely dependent on grit. The lesson is that perseverance is the most valuable thing to focus on, skill comes second, and talent is something you can't control.

“Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.

Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”

Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. The longer you live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain. suffering and futility. Listen, everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace, initiates war. and hatred is born in order to protect love. There are nexuses causal relationships that cannot be separated.
