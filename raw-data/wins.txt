I wrote a cool article for my blog!
https://www.abhilashatandon.com/blog/spotify-genre-mapping
or at least i think its cool
disco — 06/09/2024, 13:04
Love this, I don't think my pea brain understood it fully but I got the general idea! It's so cool 😁
Abhi also hates web dev — 06/09/2024, 13:14
no you're good, I probably didn't explain it that well
I'll add some pictures or something
disco — 06/09/2024, 14:21
No u did, u blog post was 👏
Oliver — 11/09/2024, 08:55
omg gurlllll
YOU WEBSITE IS SOOO COOL OMFG!!!!
OH OHHH AND I LOVEEEEE THAT COLOUR FINDER THINGY!!!!
:GivesLove:
Abhi also hates web dev — 11/09/2024, 11:15
yay thank you! I'm worried it looks kinda goofy but I'm glad you like it
MapopoStanley — 24/09/2024, 18:07
I've been working on this for a few days. This is the first project where I understood the logic a lot quicker! I'm way more confident with javascript and node. I'll be making another one for my portfolio where the isbn isn't needed and authentication. After this I'll be covering security, react.js and learning python. I'm actually excited instead of dreading it!

responsiveness left the chat
Abhi also hates web dev — 28/09/2024, 17:04
noooo 😦
I hate css
oh wait it looks mostly fine
I'm gonna like completely redesign it in a bit though I hate how it looks
RJ — 29/09/2024, 03:51
use tailwind then 😐
MapopoStanley — 29/09/2024, 06:21
This is part of the css for my portfolio website. Its the simplest way to make a responsive webpage. You'd style your page normally then at the end use  the media rule.

MapopoStanley — 29/09/2024, 06:31
I also used flexbox but from seeing other people's opinions I don't know how many people actually like using it. It might require a lot of shuffling too. I look back at other projects in my portfolio and I'm putting off going back to change the styling because of this. My portfolio website has the simplest and best use (where I can understand and explain why I used certain things) of flexbox styling. 
RJ — 29/09/2024, 07:00
bro u do vanilla ?
MapopoStanley — 29/09/2024, 07:17
Vanilla and bootstrap. I'm focused on learning different coding languages. Styling seems easy to pick up. At the same time, I noticed that when I'm not confident with styling it affects how quickly I can put together a functional project. I do want to learn SASS. 
Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 07:49
nah, you see I have to make things harder for myself
brain is weird
Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 07:53
it looks pretty responsive to me though is the thing. I spent a lot of time on that. what exactly do you think is wrong?
can I see like a screenshot
RJ — 29/09/2024, 09:55
well, it is in demand nowadays.. good developers who can put together complex designs.. that's why 3js is getting popular cause of 3d animation
RJ — 29/09/2024, 09:58
well i inspected your webpage in my browser... it seems that for shorter width it is not putting up the navbar contents properly. also u didn't used any hamburger menu so that's also something you might wanna add. 
and some exta advice.. try to make your portfolio look visually appealing rather than just getting all the content together
Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 09:59
yeah Ive been kinda slacking off on working on it. I had another website i was making for someone else (which looks much better than mine actually). I'm gonna work on redesigning it to look better since I think it looks kinda bad now. if only I knew stuff abt graphic design 😮‍💨
Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 10:00
hamburger menu's a good idea
RJ — 29/09/2024, 10:00
ohh so u do freelancing
Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 10:01
mhmm!
I've only done one website though 😂
RJ — 29/09/2024, 10:01
yeah u can say that.. but it's pretty basic idea when u talk about responsiveness in smaller width
RJ — 29/09/2024, 10:03
ohh.. same here i had also made some websites for people
Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 10:07

Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 10:12

Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 10:17
yeah u see I'm a loser who likes to do everything from scratch
RJ — 29/09/2024, 10:18
🥲idk if it is sarcastic...
Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 10:19
it's meant to be self deprecating sorry
I'm insulting myself not u
RJ — 29/09/2024, 10:20
if ur using google then it also workes on Oauth2.0
i use Oauth2.0 + jwt
Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 10:22
ok cool
I wanna try doing an authentication system from scratch at some point. I'm obv not going to like use it for anything serious ofc 
RJ — 29/09/2024, 10:36
ohh.. well that's cool too
Abhi also hates web dev — 29/09/2024, 10:37

sharing one more for the week to inspire y'all to lock in (LMFAO):

i founded a women in STEM club in my uni earlier this year, and as soon as we got officially set up in the university, not even a day ago, we had Evidentia Institute (founded by Western University, but has v cool universities like harvard, stanford, uPenn, etc) send us an email asking if we want to collab. they're a research-based group that focuses on tech and healthcare, primarily involving AI/ML to help detect early signs of diseases and/or symptoms in the human body

if anyone is interested in researching AI topics, this might b a cool one for u to look at, as an independent researcher!

YOOO congrats Jei!!! Did you just apply online or did you talk to a recruiter/company employee while applying?

After 100 applications I finally got a second company to reach out via recruiter. It’s a local company too!! Excite :3

 — 05/10/2024, 12:05
i applied through my university's internship website!
it honestly wasnt looking good at first bc a lot of the positions were out of city, and knowing canada, they wouldnt help w the accommodations, and even js leaving for 4 months wasnt worth it, so i opted to look for jobs within the city
[CHAR] — 05/10/2024, 12:09
I’m finding that local hybrid/in-person jobs are way less competitive than national fully remote jobs. Like 100 applicants vs 6000+ applicants! 

I believe in you!!
There are just wayyy fewer of them lol


🧚  server momma jei
[<3?]
 — 05/10/2024, 12:11
most, if not all positions from where i am are in-person, so it wasnt js worth it, so im definitely going to be fighting for this govt job 😭
there are two open positions and i had js found out that my friend also applied for it, so we're both hoping we get in LMFAO
[CHAR] — 05/10/2024, 12:13
For sure, I haven’t seen one hybrid/remote internship yet, so I guess they’re usually in person. 

Yessss get it!!

You have a contact me button that doesn't work. And also two contact me blurbs, which is a bit repetitive, don't you think?

I just got/accepted a job offer! It's a contract-to-hire Associate Software Engineering position through a pretty large company. The next year is going to have 4 rotations where I focus on one specific aspect and get various certifications and trainings paid for by the company/recruiting company. I'm incredibly excited and I think it's going to be a good way to get that experience I need. The pay is alright and I'm close enough that I can live at home with my mom.
job offer!
