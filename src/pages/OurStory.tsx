              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Many of our members are one of the few women in their local tech environments, feeling isolated in classes or workplaces dominated by men. We're redefining what community looks like by providing an online space where they can connect, share, and support each other.

                We bridge the gap between talented young women and the opportunities that often remain hidden within elite circles. By sourcing internships, scholarships, and events, we place them right in front of the girlies via Discord, Instagram, and TikTok, ensuring that no opportunity is out of reach due to lack of visibility.
